[Demo & Documentation](http://tonybogdanov.github.io/poly-crypt/bower_components/poly-crypt/)

`<poly-crypt>` provides a family of cryptographic algorithms through a [Polymer](https://polymer-project.org) element.

## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install

## Playing With Your Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, it's recommended that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at `http://localhost:8080/components/poly-crypt/`.
